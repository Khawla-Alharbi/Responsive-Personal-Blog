# Responsive-Personal-Blog

This is the first project for the Front End Web Developer - MCIT program

This project required me to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website.

I used Grid and Flexbox to create the layout of this website pages.
Also, I used media query  to make it responsive.
